**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Active - Project Kickoff Phase

**Advisor:** [To be specified]
**Institution:** Islamic University of Technology, Department of CSE

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
Develop and validate a sequential continual learning framework that enables effective cross-lingual transfer for low-resource Bangla NLP tasks. This research will demonstrate that strategic language curriculum design combined with continual learning techniques can improve Bangla NLP performance while providing interpretable insights into cross-lingual knowledge transfer dynamics.

### Core Innovation
Transform cross-lingual transfer from a static "which source is best" question into a dynamic "how does knowledge accumulate and decay across sequential language transitions" problem by integrating continual learning into multi-source transfer pipelines.

### Research Impact
- **Academic:** Novel framework combining curriculum learning + continual learning + cross-lingual transfer
- **Practical:** Evidence-based guidelines for building multilingual NLP systems for low-resource languages
- **Methodological:** Distinction between constructive vs. catastrophic forgetting in language transfer
- **Community:** Open-source toolkit and reproducible experimental pipeline

---

## Problem Statement

### The Core Challenge
Bangla is a low-resource language with limited annotated data for NLP tasks (~20-50K examples for most tasks). Existing approaches use single-source cross-lingual transfer, but this approach:

1. **Ignores knowledge accumulation:** Treats each language pair independently rather than examining how knowledge builds sequentially
2. **Doesn't measure forgetting:** No systematic study of what knowledge is lost when transitioning to new languages
3. **Lacks curriculum design:** No investigation of optimal language ordering for transfer
4. **Misses interpretability:** Performance metrics alone don't explain *how* transfer works or *what* gets learned/forgotten

### Why It Matters
- **Low-resource languages** represent 80% of world languages but get 20% of NLP investment
- **Continual learning** is critical for real-world deployment (languages/tasks arrive incrementally)
- **Bangla specifically** serves 300M+ speakers but has severely limited NLP resources
- **Understanding transfer dynamics** is fundamental to advancing multilingual AI

### Opportunity
Sequential multi-source continual learning can simultaneously improve performance AND provide deeper insights into cross-lingual knowledge transfer, positioning this work at the intersection of three important research areas.

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goal
**Demonstrate that sequential continual learning with strategic curriculum design outperforms single-source transfer and provides interpretable insights into cross-lingual knowledge dynamics for low-resource Bangla NLP.**

### Research Goals (RQs)

#### RQ1: Sequential vs. Single-Source Transfer
**Question:** How does sequential continual learning across multiple source languages compare to single-source transfer for Bangla NLP?

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement all baseline conditions (direct, pairwise, joint multilingual)
- [ ] Implement sequential Path A (Hindi → Marathi → Tamil → Telugu → Bangla)
- [ ] Path A demonstrates ≥5% F1 improvement over best single-source baseline OR reveals interpretable forgetting patterns
- [ ] Results hold across all 4 tasks (SA, NER, NLI, News Classification)
- [ ] Few-shot variants (100/500/1000 examples) show consistent trends

#### RQ2: Language Curriculum Design
**Question:** How do different language curriculum orderings affect final Bangla performance and intermediate forgetting patterns?

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement Path B (Distant→Similar) and Path C (Alternating)
- [ ] Statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between orderings OR clear explanation why differences don't matter
- [ ] Path A hypothesis (Similar→Distant optimal) either validated or meaningfully refuted
- [ ] Forgetting pattern analysis shows curriculum effects at each transition
- [ ] Clear recommendation: "Use Path A" or "Ordering doesn't matter because..."

#### RQ3: Linguistic Distance Predictability
**Question:** Can linguistic distance metrics predict catastrophic forgetting magnitude during cross-lingual transitions?

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Pre-compute linguistic distance metrics (lexical, syntactic, morphological overlap)
- [ ] Correlation analysis (Pearson/Spearman) between distance and forgetting (r > 0.6 considered strong)
- [ ] Control for confounds: dataset size, data quality, task type
- [ ] Regression model: `Forgetting_Rate = f(linguistic_distance, data_size, task_type)`
- [ ] Model explains ≥50% variance (R² > 0.5)

#### RQ4: Linguistic Feature Resilience
**Question:** Which linguistic features are most resilient vs. fragile during continual cross-lingual transfer?

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Design/implement linguistic probing tasks (morphological, syntactic, lexical)
- [ ] Run probes at each checkpoint
- [ ] Identify feature-specific forgetting patterns (e.g., "morphology survives better than lexical features")
- [ ] Correlate feature degradation with language transitions
- [ ] Provide interpretable insights about what the model learns/forgets

### Contribution Goals

#### Empirical Contribution
- [ ] First systematic comparison of sequential multi-source continual learning for Bangla

#### Theoretical Contribution
- [ ] **Constructive vs. Catastrophic Forgetting Framework:** Distinguish beneficial forgetting (adaptive unlearning) from harmful forgetting (feature loss)
  - Operational definition: `Adaptation_Gain = Bangla_gain - (Source_loss × proximity_weight)`
  - If Adaptation_Gain > 0 → Constructive; if < 0 → Catastrophic
- [ ] Connect forgetting patterns to linguistic distance metrics
- [ ] Potential novel insights for continual learning community beyond NLP

#### Practical Contribution
- [ ] Evidence-based guidelines for practitioners building multilingual systems
- [ ] Decision tree: when to use sequential vs. joint training

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Path A doesn't improve over baselines** | Medium | High | Pre-plan interpretability analysis; position as "understanding dynamics" even if no gains |
| **GPU compute exhausted** | Low | High | Prioritize Must-Have experiments; parallelize intelligently; defer Paths B/C if needed |
| **Dataset quality issues** | Low | Medium | Use established benchmarks (XNLI-Indic, BLUB); validate data before experiments |
| **Hyperparameter sensitivity** | Medium | Medium | Use published IndicBERT settings; grid search only if results unexpected |
| **Writing/Documentation delays** | Medium | Medium | Start writing early (Month 5); use templates; plan buffer month |
| **Advisor feedback causes scope creep** | Medium | High | Clearly defined Must-Have vs. Should-Have tiers; regular checkpoints to align expectations |
| **Team coordination issues** | Low | Medium | Clear task assignments; weekly sync meetings; documentation-first approach |
| **Generalization concerns from reviewers** | Medium | Medium | Test on multiple tasks; mention XLM-R/mBERT as future robustness checks |

### Contingency Plans

#### Scenario 1: Path A Performance is Neutral
**Plan B:** Emphasize interpretability contributions
- Shift focus to forgetting patterns, linguistic feature analysis
- Position as "understanding *how* transfer works, not just *whether* it improves"
- Still publishable with different framing

#### Scenario 2: GPU Time Insufficient
**Plan B:** Prioritize strategic experiments
- Keep Must-Have tier (baselines + Path A) inviolable
- Defer Paths B/C to "future work"
- Use statistical projections for missing conditions if needed

#### Scenario 3: Unexpected Results
**Plan B:** Investigate deeply
- Schedule Month 3 deep-dive session with advisor
- Consider confound explanations (data quality, hyperparameters)
- May reveal interesting insights (e.g., "Distant→Similar works just as well")
